						<Text className={classes.txt}>
							Cities and urban areas hold not only hundreds of
							thousands of people, but also buildings and
							structures that absorb the sun's energy and re-emit
							it in larger amounts than other areas. These areas
							then become relatively extremely hot, even during
							winter in many places. Because the heat is localized
							within these areas, they are called{" "}
							<strong style={{ color: "#11c269" }}>
								urban heat islands

						<Space h="md" />
						<Text className={classes.txt}>
							As climate change worsens around the world, so too
							have the effects of urban heat islands on nearby
							cities and their populations. Summers lasting longer
							means heat will be more consistently impactful,
							local governments and individuals need to pay more
							for short term solutions like air conditioning, and
							worst of all: the rate of heat-related injuries and
							mortalities will only increase as time goes on.
							<br />
							<br />
							This is especially true for underprivileged
							communities, who often live in more concentrated
							areas and may not be able to afford methods of
							combatting the heat. Seniors and young children are
							also especially vulnerable.

						This is where our app comes in, it is:
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>map with heat data that shows the locations of the emergencies</strong></li>
						<li>A <strong>message board for authorities to report said emergencies</strong> and <strong>state what immediate or long-term actions must be taken.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						We will be able to inform local authorities of emergencies in the nearby area where intervention is immediately needed, and pinpoint areas that are affecting nearby communities most. The app will list solutions that apply to that area in their situations.
						<br />
						<br />
						Shown is a map of Philadelphia, where our app was originally built, highlighting the areas most vulnerable to heat-related deaths; the amount of areas in yellow and above demonstrate the brevity of this issue. People are <strong>dying of preventable causes</strong>.
						<br />
						<br />
						With these tools, we help municipalities and local organizations pinpoint where aid is necessary and what must be done. Everyone, especially those most capable of helping, will better know the effects of heat in our cities, countless lives will be saved, and we will aid the struggle against climate change and its dire consequences.
